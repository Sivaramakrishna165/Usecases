How to Deploy and Test in AWS Lambda:
1. Create two separate Lambda functions in the AWS Management Console.
2. For each function:
    - Paste the corresponding Python code.
    - Configure an appropriate execution role (with necessary permissions).
3. Test the functions using the AWS Lambda console or by invoking them with appropriate payloads using AWS CLI or API Gateway.

These two simple yet functional examples cover diverse use cases: an API call to a third-party service (weather information) and a basic data manipulation task (string reversal). Let me know if you need guidance on how to set them up in AWS or any other use cases!
